# Smart ToDo List

## App Summary

A smart, auto-categorizing todo list app. The user simply has to add the name of the thing, and it gets put into the correct list. Each todo created should be categorized as one of:

* Film / Series (To watch)
* Restaurants, cafes, etc. (To eat)
* Books (To read)
* Products (To buy)

Users are able to change a category of an item in case it was mis-categorized or could not be categorized at all.

Users are able to register, log in, log out and update their profile.

This app was produced in collaboration with fellow Lighthouse labbers: [~Jo](https://github.com/jowood) and [~Alex](https://github.com/alex-ac2).
